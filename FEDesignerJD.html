      <h1>Are you looking for a change?</h1>
      <p class="italics">
        We believe in pushing boundaries. Where everyone else likes to do things by hand we like to automate. Where
        others tell you there is no solution and that is how things are we like to find solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="italics">
        That makes everyone at Blend IT try out new things and see how we can improve things for us and for our
        customers
      </p>
      <p class="italics">
        You can be part of an environment that allows you to try things where you are not limited to any one area.
      </p>

        Want to know what makes us different? Read on.

        <p>
          Here at Blend IT we believe that the only way you can improve is by experimenting. We believe that the
           only way to find out what works and what does not is by trying it. We do not ascribe to any standard
           belief. We have one saying that goes around Just do it and verify the results

        <p>We are based out of India and Malaysia. You can decide where you want to work from. We will take care of
        all the necessary paper work.</p>

        <h4>Team</h4>
        <img src="img/People.png">
        <p>
          We are a small team so you will always interact with people who know their stuff. You will not be put on to
          a training manager or someone who is just around to manage you. We have seen that people learn so much more
          that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also have the opportunity to get your hands dirty from day one. So there is no time you will be
          spending on non-critical work.
